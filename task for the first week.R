# on the cars_pages you can find many files.

  #1. use for loop
  #2. use lapply
  
#write a function which needs just the path, and paste all the files (in the path) into one file and return with the file. 


# task with names 
#create a data.table with 1000 rows which has the following columns:
  #1. 'familyname'
  #2. 'last name'
  #3. 'gender'(male, female)
  #4. 'birth_date' it should be from 1900.01.01 till today, a random day
  #5. 'days_old' calculate how many days left from birth date.
  # 6. 'height' 
  # make a function of it, which need 3 variable: number of rows, familynames, lastnames
